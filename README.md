A simple command-line **Address Book application** written in C. This project allows users to add, Edit, List, search, and delete
contacts using file handling and structures. Itâ€™s a great hands-on project for beginners to learn about **C programming**, **file operations**, and **struct-based data management**.


Features:

->Add new contact (Name, Phone, Email)
->Edit all saved contacts
->Search contacts by name,phone number,email
->List contact by name,phone number,email
->Delete contact by name,phone number,email
->Persistent storage in File handling
-> Modular code with clean functions


Technologies Used:

- C Language
- Standard C Libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`
- File Handling in C
- Structs 

Learning Objectives:

- Understand how to handle file I/O in C
- Learn how to use structures (`struct`) to model real-world data
- Practice procedural and modular programming
- Simulate a real-world application in a low-level language
